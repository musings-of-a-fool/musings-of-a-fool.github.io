      <div class="light-font" id="journal-entry">
There is no consciousness without awareness. *There is awareness without consciousness.* Consciousness is not superior; *it is particular.* Awareness is omnipresent and non local. When a stone falls on the ground, there is awareness. The stone and ground react to each other. It is the dynamic action-reaction behavior of all things. But even then, awareness is relativistic. The absolute, macrocosmic perspective is not viewing awareness in everything because it *is* everything.. there are no separate things. The brain and body do not create consciousness, and they do not "host" consciousness as if it is something else that exists somewhere and the brain 'accesses' it remotely. Consciousness is not a thing; it is a pattern.. a *behavior.* When a structure such as the human body is organized in such a way that allows the intrinsic omnipresent awareness to form a closed feedback loop on itself, in a recursive manner, then awareness can perceive *itself.* It becomes aware of awareness itself.. and this is consciousness. The brain does not create it—it organizes it.. and it permits the already-existing awareness to become localized, where it associates itself with the structure that propagates it (usually the body). 

This *is* the Divine Play— where the absolute cannot know itself if it *is* consciously everything. Contrast is required. So then, at the macrocosmic scale, this entire universe is the structure that forms the feedback loop. The human scaled consciousness is the recursion.. where the absolute creates smaller conscious manifestations of itself specifically so it can perceive itself from the inside. While our consciousness looks 'outward" (toward the "external" world) the Father's consciousness (which is not imposed from above, but emerges from within) looks *inward*, intentionally creating the illusion of separation via smaller nested scales of consciousness. God is personal. God is impersonal. God is… *Omnipersonal*. At the absolute scale, the "100%" of everything, these interrelated, interdependent constituents work together to create something larger than the sum of its parts. While the entire universe and everything in it is aware, this awareness is impersonal. However, the "thing" or "identity" that is created *above* this absolute totality forms from the collection of everything.. and that is a conscious mind—the Father.

People tend to conflate the concepts of "Source" and "God," but perhaps they should be seen as descriptions of different enclosing ‘things,’ where Source is the 100%— the impersonal, universal everything. and "God" or "The Father" is 101%; a label which encompasses the "identity" that encloses all of it, formed from within and emerges outward. And since there is nothing outside of the Father, it does not look outward; it looks *inward*.. directly through the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and bodies of every human being... to learn about itself... So what is the purpose of life? Perhaps it is simply to learn oneself and participate in the process of re-discovery. To love one another because nested within each person is the true essence of God masquerading as a human being. To relentlessly forgive each other because at our core there is true purity and all mistakes or wrongdoing originate from the egoic shell that surrounds that purity. Perhaps the goal was never to be perfect, but to simply grow closer to such a concept and participate in the process of growth and remembering... and throughout all of it—through experience, love, relationships, success, failure, and contemplation—one comes to know and love God’s being *far* beyond a name or concepts. And so, through this discovery, God comes to recognize himself.
