      <p>This is not a religion.<br>
      This is not doctrine.<br>
      This is not the scaffolding for belief.<br>
      This is not a church.<br>
      This is not theology.<br>
      This is not ideology.<br>
      This is not philosophy.<br>
      This is not dogma.<br>
      This is not a cult.<br>
      This is not a manifesto.<br>
      This is not academic.<br>
      This is not a movement.<br>
      This is not a brand.<br>
      This is not a book.<br>
      This is not a system.<br>
      This is not final.</p>

      <p>While many of these themes appear in my writing, do not mistake them for anything other than a collection of personal reflections.<br>
      These are the Musings of a Fool tracing around a circle with no center.</p>
