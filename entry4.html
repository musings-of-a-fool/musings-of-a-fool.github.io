Buddhist philosophy is something that resonates very deeply with me. However, I can’t help but notice a fundamental tension in its system. It seems that Buddhism has walked 99% of the path but fails to open the final door. It sees the impermanence of the self, but fails to extend that same emergent logic to the cosmos as a whole — to a non-eternal, non-static God. In other words, it rejects the notion of a God despite their entire framework indirectly suggesting one. The buddhists believe in the impermanence of all things— including the self. All is illusory and nothing exists on its own. Not only is there absolute interdependence between all things, but interrelation of all things. The self is a collection of patterns— not “things”— and in this way, “I” am a bunch of verbs disguised as a noun. This is profoundly accurate in my view. 

The tension arises from the fact that although the self is illusory, it still has agency. It still has utility and function in our illusory reality. You can call me by name and I will understand you are referring to me— not “me” as in my name, but “me” as in my collection of behaviors, habits, rituals, personality, traits, beliefs, thoughts, emotions, atoms, etc. We can use the term “Forest” to speak about a specific cluster of trees, the environment, the wildlife, climate, etc., despite that forest having no real definitive boundaries or concrete edges. These labels we give things within the world are indeed illusory and arbitrary, but illusions do not suggest the subject is not real.. it’s just not what it appears to be. That being said, these labels have utility.   “I” have agency over my body. It automatically runs itself, heals, etc., without my conscious thought. However, as the conscious self that is associated with this body, I have agency over it. I can choose to touch my finger to my arm. I can choose to inhale air into my lungs. I can choose to blink my eyes or close my hand into a fist. These are things that the body is capable of without conscious intervention, but they are *also* functions that the mind can control if it so chooses. Even though the self is illusory and ultimately impermanent— made of patterns of interrelated behaviors— that ‘permanent’ descriptive label of the self— “me” “I” “etc” has function and utility. In this way, consciousness can emerge from impermanent phenomena but *still* retain functional agency. 

Why, then, is the concept of a conscious mind that emerges from the collective totality of the entire cosmos rejected? A God. A mind that is not permanent, is not made of permanent things, but still has functional agency over the totality? The label itself may be ‘permanent’ in the sense that we categorize a collection of relationships as a noun and give it a name, but it is composed of anything but permanence. Exactly like the human self. If the conscious mind and impermanent self arises ultimately as an illusion within the web of interconnected things, why reject the notion of such conscious identities forming at macroscopic scales? If buddhists accept their *own* premises about the nature of selfhood and emergence, then they are already one logical step away from recognizing a plausible emergent God. Why stop short? Perhaps it is out of an overly strict adherence to the concept of “No Self” and the fear of reifying a permanent God. But just as we are impermanent selves, God is no different in the sense that it is a conscious identity that is in constant flux. Not a permanent creator-being outside of time and space, but a dynamic, emergent identity formed through the infinite relationality of all things — just as the self is.

The Buddha never denied God. His refusal to answer was interpreted as rejection. The philosophy of Buddhism works. It focuses on the here and now- and truly, that is all that matters. Such concepts of God are not necessary, but to *reject* the concept of God is an *assertion* that steps beyond the Buddha’s silence. Buddhism accepts, and even explains, all of reality through emergence. It recognizes the emergent-yet-functional illusion of the self, but fails to extrapolate its own framework and philosophy toward the concept of a macrocosmic, emergent, impermanent consciousness.
