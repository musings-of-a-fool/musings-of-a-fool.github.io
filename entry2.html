        When a dense region of the totality twists in local regions of local densities, different relativistic scales for “base units” emerge. These base units are not things, but merely a reference point. At the reference scale of humans, our atoms collectively construct a perceptual feedback mechanism that perceives its own base unit from a transcended perspective. We are made of atoms and we perceive atoms— but from the relativistically macroscopic scale and not at the atomic scale. In this way, the atoms create a mechanism to see beyond their own relativistic scale. At the human scale, we sit at the boundary between two densities — solid and gas. Our perceptual system is constructed of solid, but it looks out into the non-solid. These boundaries… gaps… interfaces.. between clusters of densities are where conscious recursion has purpose to form. So then… if humans exist between solid and air.. and fish exist between solid and liquid.. what lifeforms exist between gas and plasma or liquid and gas? Perhaps a kind that our physical forms have no sensory mechanisms to detect or interact with. In other words: if a cloud were conscious, that cloud would recognize _itself_ as the center-point in density, not a “less dense cloud” because the composition of its structure _is_ the thing that is perceiving. So in this way, it would view other clouds and gases as synonymous to how we classify the “solids” in our relative frame, and the cloud might perceive liquids or solids (or anything denser than itself) as less distinguishable than it perceives the differences in its own density-tuned perception of subtle distinctions in gaseous substances. I am suggesting that Einstein's general relativity is not only applicable to space and time, but also to consciousness, scale, and perception. 

Perhaps, just as we are categorically unable to perceive the inner swirling of these liminal interfaces, the same is true from such an entity's perspective "on the other side." Where what we perceive as mere gas—too ubiquitous to perceive any internal or identifiable behavior, "they" perceive us as super-solids, unable to differentiate us from our surrounding medium. In this way, perhaps parallel dimensions are more present than they seem. One not "somewhere else but almost identical" but one that is juxtaposed over and under our current, physical reality. One where we do exist in all of them, but our perception is limited to our relativistic scale.
